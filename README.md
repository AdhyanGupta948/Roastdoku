A fully native Android Sudoku game with a built-in roast bot that playfully comments on your gameplay.

Roastdoku – The Sudoku That Roasts You 🔥

Roastdoku is a modern, clean, minimalistic Sudoku game — with a twist:
the game gently (or not-so-gently) roasts you while you play.

Whether you make a wrong move, take too long, or just pick the “Easy” mode… the in‑game AI narrator always has something to say.
